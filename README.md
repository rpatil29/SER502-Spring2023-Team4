**Platform**
- Mac OS
- Windows OS
- Linux OS

**Tools**

- ANTLR Tool: ANTLR(Another Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.
- Java Language

**Data Structures**

- HashMap
- List
- Map

**Install Instructions**

#### Clone the Repository

`git clone https://github.com/rpatil29/SER502-Spring2023-Team4.git`

**Run Instructions**

Execute the jar file with command

```
java -jar SER502_Spring2023_Team4.jar
```

**Highlights**

- The language has been designed by drawing inspiration from the java programming language and the syntax has been kept simple and user-friendly.

- Supports primitive data types such as **int, boolean and string**

- Support for Arithmetic operations such as **addition, subtraction, multiplication and division** on the data types

- Support for Logical operations such as **&&, || and !**.

- Supports looping structures like **for loop, for in range loop and while loop.**

- Support conditional operations: **if-then-else**

- Support for Relational operations such as **==, <, > , <=, >=.**

- Support for Assignment operator which associates a value with an identiÔ¨Åer.

- Support for ternary operator like **? :**

- Support for string concatenation (**+**)

**Future Scope**

In terms of future scope, the language could be extended to support these advanced features and integrated with 
other tools and libraries to make it more powerful and useful.  With the increasing concern around security in software development, the language could be extended to include more robust security features. Additionally, the language could be optimized to improve its performance and make it suitable for building high-performance applications. Overall, there are many possibilities for extending and improving the language to make it more powerful, efficient, and useful for a wide range of applications.
